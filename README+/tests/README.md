This section branches from conceptual discussions of [Tests](https://github.com/Kyriosity/read-write/tree/main/README+/software/tests), and [Quality Assurance](https://github.com/Kyriosity/read-write/tree/main/README+/software/QA) and proposes realistic decisions for programmatic tests and their automation.

## NUnit boosting

NUnit is a conventional, reliable, and universal test framework, but like most FOSS, it has limited resources, and its contributors aren't obliged to any delivery.

There are apparent items to estimate:

+ bulky and restrained syntax (and it's not [DAMP](https://github.com/Kyriosity/read-write/blob/main/README+/software/tests/asQA/README+/tests-damp_vs_dry.md)),
+ pending bugs,
+ missing calls and features.

## Challenges, posers, and their solutions

## Wrap up. A word on definitions

_Unit Tests_ are only a slice of the test pyramid, but technically they may serve all other types and layers (I can't remember <kbd>New -> Integration test</kbd> in IDEs).
