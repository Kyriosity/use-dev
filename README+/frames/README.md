<p><b>The expanse between <ins>architectural/design</ins> decisions and <ins>implementation</ins></b> unties programming hands to code a feature in multiple variations (the same as a tongue can describe the same thing in different forms and ways).</p>
<p>Let alone syntax preferences, which selection begins from the very first letter: capitalize, underscore, or not.</p>
<p>This stimulates creativity, competitiveness, and the search for better syntax, but on a large scale the bigger the assortment, the greater the disorder.</p>
<p>Thus any big team or foundation gradually establishes certain frames and rules of coding, which shall not be dogmatic and, sure, can't be fully applied (noticeable when over 50%).</p>

The metaphor of code as <mark>cement</mark> was applied to underline <a href="https://github.com/Kyriosity/read-write/blob/main/README+/software/QA/README+/code-quality.md">code quality</a>.
     Then design activities can be <mark>formworks</mark> of the concrete, and coding rules, guidelines, and frames can be seen as <mark>reinforcement</mark>.
