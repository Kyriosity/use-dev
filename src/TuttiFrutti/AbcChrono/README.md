# Chronology - Timelines - Events

Time is the _driver_ for all and the "solvent" of everything. The former is for software and the latter for its hardware.

Exact time measurement<sup>🔬</sup> and timestamping aren't an issue for regular solutions but chronology.

Software of the previous millennium gave literally bits for dates, thus nurturing the giant Y2K bug. Contemporary languages can support a vast range of past and future dates<sup>📆</sup>, but badly organize them.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>🔬</sup> <sub>Unless you need accuracy close to [physics on steroids](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2023/summary/).<sup>🔗</sup></sub>\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>📆</sup> <sub>Astonishly surrending to Java  C# `DateTime`supports only Common Era. Though there're Calendar classes.</sub>

## Framework - Theses

### Initial requirements

+ Intuitive syntax
+ Approximation
+ Guards: range limit (e.g. 1-28/29/30/31 for months) compile- and run-time ()

### Next - Features and demands 

+ Fuzzy comparisson
+ Glossary 
+ Casting
+ More chronologies

### The crown - Integration with U-Val

## C# solution 

Disclaimer! Version&nbsp;**1** this is a functional sketch. A foundation to try and release all-around solution. 

### Remarks 


### Alternatives

One-page (single-class) wizard.

Wizard VM over model with masking.

### Implementation blog

#### Layout 

basic simplified logic and syntax over it. TDD tests to prove and demo.

#### Shortcuts for eras with masks

interfaces to mask methods

3) Parametrize with INumber 
4) Timeline Model
5) Guards
6)
